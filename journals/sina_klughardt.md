- Merged orders enpoints

- Started with Frontend Auth with Santiago

- Implemented a nav bar on the front end and merged it into main

## May 20, 2023

- Finished "get one order" and "update an order" Endpoints

- I need to ask my teammates about some details(functionality) about these endpoints, at the moment only the user is able to see all their orders. I think a shop should also be able to do that.
