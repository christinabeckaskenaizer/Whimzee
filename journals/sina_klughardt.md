- Categories on frontend are now clickable

## May 24, 2023

Implemented some functionality today
- Created a login and sign in page
- Login is working now
- Made the nav bar more functional -> User can now navigate to account and to log in if logged out
- if logged in the user sees wishlist, account and cart
- Put Auth on index.js file so we can get the token on the App.js file and we can pass it down to all the Route, so we don't have to make a fetch request everytime
- if you submit and you are logged in you get redirected to Landing page
